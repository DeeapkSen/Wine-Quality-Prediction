# Wine Quality Analysis and Prediction
This repository hosts a data science project aimed at analyzing and predicting the quality of wines based on physicochemical properties. Using various statistical and machine learning methods, this project seeks to uncover the underlying patterns that distinguish higher quality wines from lower quality ones and to predict the quality based on those patterns.

## Overview
The wine industry values accurate predictions of wine quality based on measurable attributes. This project employs both exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling to determine how different physicochemical properties contribute to the overall quality rating of a wine. By developing robust models, we can provide valuable insights to vintners and help consumers make informed choices.

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Delve into the dataset to identify key characteristics and distributions of various physicochemical properties in wines.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Process the data for analysis by handling missing values, normalizing data, and performing feature scaling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Enhance the dataset by creating new features that could better correlate with wine quality.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Build and train several machine learning models to predict wine quality based on the features.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics like MSE (Mean Squared Error) and accuracy.
- **Result Visualization:** Employ visual tools to illustrate the relationships between wine characteristics and quality and to display model performance.

## Dataset
This project uses a dataset that includes several physicochemical properties of wines, such as acidity, sugar content, alcohol level, and pH, along with a quality rating from experts. The dataset is sourced from the kaggle.
